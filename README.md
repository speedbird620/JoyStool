# JoyStool
This project is intended is sprung from the disapointment of using a joystick bought from an electronics store for 120â‚¬. Being unable to fly ass accurate I started to think outside the box: How can I do this better with an reasonable budget? This page is my answer to this question. 

After a few prototypes I landed in a solution where a control assembly is mounted on a chair. The prototyes prooved that adequate control was feasable with reasoable control dynamics. 

a do-it-yourself flight simulator with physical flight controls. 

. For most people the electronic hardware and software is the main obstacle. Therefore the JoyStool projects is a two step project.

Firstly, an easy and comprehencable electronics and software package which is easy to use and easy to understand. Secondly, an IKEA-style kit in plywood with prefabricated parts easy to assemble and start flying. If you want you can combine the two into a 

The skill level required is opted for an average glider pilot with limited soldering skill. This is not rocket sience. 



The requirements for the simulator:
 - The parts shall be avilable in general stores (as far as possible)
 - A simple construction
 - Dual control
 - Stick, rudder and airbrake
 - Airbrake shall be able to be used as throttle and collector after minor alteration
 - Tow cable release
 - Position of pedals are adjustable
 - 

The electronics and software package contains of:
 - Design schematic for Arduino Leonardo or Arduino Micro (ATMEGA32U4)
 - Software and libraries
 - Bespoke PCB-adaptor between Arduino and electrical connectors
 - Bill of material for recomended components ot order
 - Bespoke PCB-adaptor for recomended hall sensors
 -
